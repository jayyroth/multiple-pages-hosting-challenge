        History of Black Cats
      </h1>

      <p class="about-paragraph">Black cats have earned the title of misfortune & bad luck, as well as 
       people associating them with evil & Satanic worship. However, this wasn't 
       always the brand of the Black Cat. In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped; 
       in Celtic Mythology, a sign of a Black Cat signified prosperity; and in 
       Britain & Japan, Black Cats are actually a sign of <em>good</em> luck.
